## AI4Good Framework Alignment

- **Problem Definition**: Addressing poor urban air quality and its impact on health.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensuring transparency, fairness, and reproducibility.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engaging with public health officials and the community.
- **Impact Measurement**: Defining KPIs such as prediction accuracy, alert coverage, and actionable recommendations.

---

## Objectives & Measurable Results

- **Objective 1**: Achieve at least 90% accuracy in air quality prediction.
- **Objective 2**: Identify high-risk zones with at least 80% precision.
- **Objective 3**: Provide clear data-driven recommendations to urban planners.
- **KPIs**: Model accuracy, F1 score, deployment coverage, number of actionable insights delivered.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather urban air quality datasets from [source].
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
3. **Model Training**: Implement and tune KNN and Neural Network models.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess models using cross-validation and real-world test sets.
5. **Deployment**: Package models for real-time or batch inference.
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Use stakeholder feedback and new data to retrain and refine models.
