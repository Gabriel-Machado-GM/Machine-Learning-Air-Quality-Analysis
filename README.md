# Machine-Learning-Air-Quality-Analysis
Using Machine Learning Algorithms to monitor the Air Quality in an urban area, the project evolves by applying AI for Good Framework.

Apply the Machine Learning algorithms like KNN (K nearst neighborhood) and Neural Network Model to upgrade the predictions and obtain non linear estimatives
